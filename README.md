Note: This is a sample project for my blog on medium which can be found here https://medium.freecodecamp.org/writing-scalable-architecture-for-node-js-2b58e0523d7f.

## Get Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run npm install inside its root folder.
3. run nodemone index.js (assuming nodemon npm package is already installed in your systems)

## Client side for this project
To test this project using browser I implemented the client side of this project which is in react and redux. The blog for that could be found here https://medium.com/@zafarsaleem/login-using-react-redux-redux-saga-86b26c8180e.
